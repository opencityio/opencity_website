        <h1>On October 1st 2014, OpenCity's first event took place at Peterborough Town Hall</h1>

        <!-- SECTION DESCRIPTION -->
        <p>OpenCity is a unique project with a unique aim. Empowering the creative talent of Peterborough’s artistic and digital community, offering a chance to deliver a world first in community led development is an honourable goal, but
            underneath the rhetoric is a more primal and basic instinct. You see, a city is created by the people that live in it, atmosphere is driven by the vibrancy of its inhabitants, growth by
            ambition and pride through achievement. This OpenCity project is not a huge project, it doesn’t need to be, its a simple call to action, a metaphorical raising of the flag, pinning
            intention to the heart of its goals.</p>

        <p>Starting a project like OpenCity and courting the idea of engaging a community to develop a long standing, high profile piece of unproven technology requires courage and trust. Not simply a
            one off decision to try something new, but a chain, a set of ripples, radiating out from the first conversation. If you’re lucky, with each conversation another person agrees; sharing
            their intent to volunteer for something that might just make a small difference. Each new recruit extends a little more trust and as they do, slowly the project becomes more and more
            achievable. When enough people ask &#34;what if we can do it?&#34; the question stops being a question and becomes simply &#34;we can do it&#34; and eventually, for those that dare to
            dream, with a little luck and effort &#34;we did it&#34;.</p>

        <p><strong>Wednesday 1st October</strong> saw 60+ local people all make a decision to pledge some of their time to support a project and get involved. They came to be part of a brainstorming session to help
            dream about what might be possible, and dream they did. From local councillors, artists, engineers, CEO’s, directors, transport workers, small business owners, chefs and students everyone
            who attended got involved in a superb session to help answer 4 simple questions.</p>

        <ul class="big">
            <li>How will the screen grab people’s attention?</li>
            <li>How can local businesses engage and benefit?</li>
            <li>What can the screen do to make people want to return to it?</li>
            <li>How can the screen influence behaviour?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Attendees split into groups, faced one of the 4 challenges and responded with a barrage of inspiration and innovation. The resulting concepts, prioritised by the teams, were pitched back to
            the whole audience who then took time to vote for their favourites. Those ideas generated a backlog of features that will be carried over into a hack-a-thon, a chance for people to create
            a real solution to stand proudly as a purposeful tool for visitors to the town centre but also a symbol of what can happen when people share capabilities and intent with a little
            trust.</p>

        <p>The greatest thing about a journey such as OpenCity is working alongside the people that choose to be involved. It’s a wonderful experience to share a common goal and even better when given
            the opportunity to realise that goal. The biggest hurdles are yet to come, more trust will be needed, more challenges overcome. The team here at OpenCity are looking forward not only to
            delivering a great event, but to being part of a community that took an opportunity to do something that our city can be proud of and to taking a few steps with you all on the way.</p>
